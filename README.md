I'm a **graduate student** in Tohoku University's [Computer Vision Lab.](https://www.vision.is.tohoku.ac.jp/?lang=en), researching [image matching](https://github.com/ericzzj1989/Awesome-Image-Matching) and [Gaussian splatting](https://github.com/MrNeRF/awesome-3D-gaussian-splatting).<br>
Working extensively with GPUs made me really appreciate how code works, optimization stuff, and system architecture around it. Since 2022, I do and break things in my homelab, _learning hands-on fundamentals_. This initiated my backend-to-DevOps journey 😉

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my Master's thesis, wish me luck! Following that, my personal website.
- 🌱 I’m also learning proper backend development with [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/) and DevOps with [kodekloud.com](https://kodekloud.com/).
- ⚙️ I use daily: `.py` (pytorch), `.go`, `.yaml` (k8s), `.sh`; often: `.sql` (postgre/lite), `.c`, `.tf`, `.dockerfile`.
- 💬 Ask me about [my unnecessarily complex homelab](homelab.jpg) 😂. Jokes aside, outside coding, I do love photography, badminton, and volleyball.
