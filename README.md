I recently graduated from Tohoku University's [Computer Vision Lab.](https://www.vision.is.tohoku.ac.jp/?lang=en) playing [image matching](https://github.com/ericzzj1989/Awesome-Image-Matching). Beside research, I love to learn the low-level things: how code works, optimization stuff, and systems around it. I do and break things daily in my homelab, _hands-on_, they said.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on my portfolio for job hunting, all the best!
- 🌱 I’m also learning proper backend development with [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/u/akhdanfadh) and DevOps with [kodekloud.com](https://kodekloud.com/).
- ⚙️ I use daily: `.py` (pytorch), `.go`, `.yaml` (k8s), `.sh`; often: `.sql` (postgre/lite), `.c`, `.tf`, `.dockerfile`.
- 💬 Ask me about [my unnecessarily complex homelab](homelab.jpg) 😂. Jokes aside, outside coding, I do love photography, badminton, and volleyball.
